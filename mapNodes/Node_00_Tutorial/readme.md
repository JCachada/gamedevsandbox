# Node 00  - Tutorial Node

## Node description / Purpose

The main purpose of this node is to serve as an introductory node for the game. It introduces the basic controls for movement, interaction, and combat. It introduces the main character and the main scenario that will compose the game's story. It is also the first node at which the player arrives after each run, that is, after the corruption level increases in the world. As such, it is also the first place to exhibit changes.

Besides all that, it is the node where the player's home is. That means that, at least at the beginning, it is where the player's family resides.

## Environment / Atmosphere

### Starting corruption

This is a small village relatively removed from the confusion of the capital and the big cities. There is a heightened sense of community here - people are friendly and worthy of trust. The weather is nice and sunny, with just enough rain to keep lands fertile. It's a green place, with vegetation and tranquility. People are hospitable and happy, if a bit concerned with the lingering threat of the corruption.

## Music Artifacts

In general, nodes will have 1-2 music artifacts per level of corruption. Some of the music artifacts will be character-related, so they'll be reused in multiple nodes whenever that character is in the spotlight.

### Starting Corruption

For the first level of corruption in the tutorial node, the following tracks are required:

* Node00_Tutorial_IdleBackground: This is the standard track that plays in the background when the player is in the node. It should be a tranquil track that transmits happiness and calm. The main keywords here are contentment and tranquility. On top of that, this track should be clearly rural, and not one that would feel more at home in a big city. Some references of tracks that fit this description are Howard Shore's *Concerning Hobbits* (the music that plays in The Shire), Stardew Valley's *The Valley Comes Alive* (Spring song), and Harvest Moon's *Back to Nature* (Spring song). **Important: This track should be loopable.**
* Node00_Tutorial_WifeTune: This is one of the most important tracks in the game, and will be replayed in other nodes whenever the player is having important, serious conversations with his wife. This is the track that runs in the background of those conversations. It should be a calm track, but in a sadder way than the previous one; the main keywords to think of here should be tranquility and peace, but also melancholy. Think of moon or candle-lit environments, intimate conversations that stretch into the early hours of the morning, and a degree of loss. Some references of tracks that fit this description are To The Moon's *Born a Stranger*, To the Moon's *Once Upon a Memory*, and Finding Paradise's *Faye's Theme*. **Important: This track should be loopable.**
* Node00_Tutorial_CorruptionComing: This is also a track that will be used for the rest of the game. It's the darkest of the three, but also the one that can have the highest pace. Think of the following scenario: the player character comes across the corruption (picture it as a dark mass, sort of an Eldritch Abomination) and freezes while the song starts playing. Then the screen cuts away to a cutscene of the corruption affecting the world and doing unspeakable things. It should be an eery track, instantly recognizable as an enemy approaching. Danger, degradation, darkness are all acceptable keywords. Some references of tracks that fit this description are the first 27 seconds of Hotline Miami 2's *Wrong Number*`, Ori and the Blind Forest's *The Blinded Forest*, Mass Effect's *Leaving Earth* (especially from the moment the beat drops with the Reaper sound) and System Shock 2's *Ops 1*. This track can be taken in a lot of different directions: the main thing is that it's eerie and the player can immediately recognize it as "bad stuff is gonna happen". It is **not** important that this track can be looped.
