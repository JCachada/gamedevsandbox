# Node 00  - Tutorial Node

## Node description / Purpose

The main purpose of this node is to serve as an introductory node for the game. It introduces the basic controls for movement, interaction, and combat. It introduces the main character and the main scenario that will compose the game's story. It is also the first node at which the player arrives after each run, that is, after the corruption level increases in the world. As such, it is also the first place to exhibit changes.

Besides all that, it is the node where the player's home is. That means that, at least at the beginning, it is where the player's family resides.

## Environment / Atmosphere

### Starting corruption

This is a small village relatively removed from the confusion of the capital and the big cities. There is a heightened sense of community here - people are friendly and worthy of trust. The weather is nice and sunny, with just enough rain to keep lands fertile. It's a green place, with vegetation and tranquility. People are hospitable and happy, if a bit concerned with the lingering threat of the corruption.
