# GameDev Sandbox - Main Development Repository

This is the main development repository for my personal game development sandbox with Godot Engine. I use it as a way to try out new systems, see if I can develop things that can then later be used in actual projects I develop.

## Who do I contact with questions

Jo√£o Cachada. You can reach me at github.com/JCachada, or visit jcachada.dev. 

## Tech stack

The sandbox is developed using Godot Engine, version 3.1, stable release. It is developed using Godot's proprietary language, GDScript, which shares syntax similarities with Python. Some performance-sensitive parts of the sandbox might be written in C#.
